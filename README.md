whereas, he would get calculated statistics where he chooses
the data and filters the data for a dataset to analyze.

I thank all the tutors, the mentors, and especially the reviewer who did offer very
detailed advice on how to improve the code. And the members from stackoverflow
who collaborated to answer questions that helped improve the quality of the code.
